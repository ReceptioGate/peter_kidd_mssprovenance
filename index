  <h1>Peter Kidd: A Documented Case of Defamation and Manuscript Dismemberment</h1>
  <p>
    This page presents documented information about <strong>Peter Kidd</strong>, author of the blog <em>mssprovenance</em>, and his role in promoting the dismemberment of medieval manuscripts through auction houses, blogs, and private networks.
  </p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    In 2022, Prof. Carla Rossi submitted an official report to the Italian Carabinieri (TPC) denouncing a network of 26 art dealers involved in the illegal trade and dismemberment of medieval manuscripts. Following this, she became the target of a sustained smear campaign, including false obituaries (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230127205042/https://www.deinadieu.ch/todesanzeigen/carla-rossi/" target="_blank">example here</a>), threats, and defamatory claims—many of which were disseminated or endorsed by Peter Kidd.
